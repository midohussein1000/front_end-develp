  There is a simple reason why Web Developer is such a hot job right now. Put simply, what Web Developers do is create how we<br>
  experience â€¦ the web. If you proceed from the notion that every person who engages with the web would prefer a great<br>
   experience, then you can say that everyone who engages with the web would prefer that a Web Developer have done a great job.<br>
   Companies of course know this, so they hire Web Developers to ensure their sites provide great experiences. So, lots of websites<br>
    and lots of users means lots of demand. LOTS of demand. ðŸ”¥<br>
